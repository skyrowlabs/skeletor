"""`repo-report` — the worked example every other job is copied from.

Two stages, and keeping them apart is the whole design:

* **Collection** (this module) is deterministic stdlib Python. It gathers facts
  and produces the same answer twice. It is what makes a finding reproducible.
* **Triage** is a headless agent reading those facts. It makes the calls a
  script cannot — what is a risk, what is noise, what changed meaningfully.

A job that skips collection and asks an agent to go and look produces a
different answer every night, and none of them can be checked.

Copy this file's shape for a new job: collect into a plain dict, hand it to
`agent_runner.run_triage`, return its exit code.
