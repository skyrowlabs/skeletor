"""Run a headless agent over collected data, and hold the rails around it.

Each job is two stages, and keeping them separate is the whole design:

* **Collection** is deterministic Python with no dependencies. It gathers facts.
  It is cheap, it is testable, and it produces the same answer twice.
* **Triage** is a headless agent that reads those facts, makes the calls a
  script cannot, and writes a report.

A job that skips the collection stage and asks an agent to go and look produces
a different answer every night, and none of them are reproducible.

The rails here exist because each was once absent:

* **A job that cannot read its tree does not guess.** It declines, records why,
  and still pings its heartbeat — an executed-and-declined job must stay
  distinguishable from a dead cron.
* **The prompt is a file, named after the module.** That is how the fix policy
  is resolved, and it means a prompt change is a reviewable diff.
* **`fix_policy` is passed to the agent explicitly.** An agent that does not
  know its blast radius will pick one.
