"""The run ledger's path comes from the resolver, not from a second definition.

Split out of `tests/test_state_paths.py`, which now ships at **core** because
`state_dir()` and `STATE_SLUG` do. This one assertion needs
`scripts.reporting.run_ledger`, which is `agentic`, so it stays here — under its
own filename rather than as a sixth test in a replacing copy of that file.

An overlay file at the same path replaces the core one whole; adding one test
that way means carrying five duplicates of the others, which is the drift this
shell exists to prevent. A second file costs nothing and drifts from nothing.

Reported by stash.flow, who adopted at `core` and found `AGENTS.md` and
`scripts/paths.py` both citing `test_state_paths.py` — a file that shipped only
at `agentic`. The rule said *run it rather than trusting the rule*, which is good
advice a core tree could not follow.
