"""Advisory holds on the shared working tree.

Advisory, not enforcing, and that is a decision rather than a limitation: a lock
that can refuse the owner's own interactive command is a lock people learn to
route around, and a routed-around lock protects nothing while looking like it
protects everything.

What it does instead is make "is somebody working here" *answerable*, so the
things that can safely refuse — scheduled jobs, branch resets, `{{CLI}} commit` — have
a fact to refuse on.

Two hold kinds, because they make different things unsafe:

    suite   a test run or stack job: writes under mounted paths, AND the branch
    edit    an editing session or a commit: the branch only

The `edit` kind exists because the incident this came from had no suite running
— just an editor and a `git checkout`. A clean `git status` is not evidence that
nobody is working here.

Stdlib only: this is imported by host-side jobs that must not grow dependencies.

#: How long a record whose process is gone is left alone before `sweep()` drops
#: it. Small on purpose: once the pid is gone the holder is definitely gone, and
#: the only thing this margin protects is the window between a record being
#: written and its writer becoming observable — a concurrent sweeper must not
#: unlink a hold that is racing its own creation.
#:
#: **A live pid is honoured at any age**, deliberately and with no upper bound.
#: Long jobs exist, and dropping a running job's hold is fail-open — the same
#: asymmetry `would_strand` is built on, where a false refusal costs one retry
#: and a false clearance costs somebody's work.
#:
#: This replaced a `STALE_AFTER_S = 6 * 60 * 60` that `sweep()` never read: the
#: constant was defined, documented with a pid-reuse rationale, and referenced
#: nowhere, while the sweep hardcoded 60. A reader budgeting for that coincidence
#: believed the window was six hours when it was one minute. Reported by
#: jam.sense. A documented rule with no code under it is the harder direction of
#: the failure this repository writes rules about — an undocumented rule at least
#: reads as unknown, where this one reads as settled.

    Holds are **per-checkout**, structurally rather than by a recorded field:
    `PROJECT_ROOT` resolves from `scripts/paths.py`'s own location, and a git
    worktree has its own copy of that file, so each checkout gets its own
    `tmp/tree-locks/`. A hold in one tree therefore cannot strand another, with
    no root field and no compatibility rule to maintain.

    jam.sense reached the same outcome by the opposite route — one lock
    directory per *repository*, plus a `root` field on each hold to claw back
    the over-reach — because they need to answer "who is holding **any** tree of
    this repo". That question is not free, and this design deliberately cannot
    ask it.

    What it must be able to ask is "is somebody working in **that** tree", and
    that is what this function is for. A caller reasoning about a checkout other
    than its own has to *name* it — the module constant is this tree's answer,
    and using it about another tree returns an empty list rather than an error.
    `{{CLI}} worktree drop` shipped exactly that way: it decided the fate of a
    checkout it never asked about, and would have kept doing so if somebody had
    "fixed" it by calling `holders()` with no argument.
