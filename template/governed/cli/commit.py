"""``{{CLI}} commit`` — commit safely in a tree other agents may be editing.

pre-commit **stashes every unstaged change in the repo** while its hooks run. In
a shared tree that deletes another agent's in-flight work from disk for the
duration of the hooks, and silently discards anything they write in that window
— including on files your commit never touches.

This runs the same checks against **only the paths you name**, then commits with
`--no-verify`, so no stash ever happens. It also reads the branch twice: once
before the checks and once immediately before staging. The checks take tens of
seconds, and that window is the whole exposure — a branch that moved under you
means your commit would land somewhere nobody expects.
