"""``{{CLI}} worktree`` — a second checkout, so two agents never share one branch.

A linked worktree is the answer to "I need a different branch" in a tree
somebody else is standing in. It costs disk and a provisioning step; it does not
cost the other agent their uncommitted work, which a `git switch` does.

**Remove it when the work is done.** A stranded tree holds hundreds of megabytes
and possibly a whole running stack.

    Anchored on `scripts.paths.REQUIREMENTS` — the file that module declares as
    *the host toolchain this tree installs* — and then follows `-r` includes, so
    an adopter who splits their requirements is covered without a registry and
    without this function being edited.

    **It is deliberately not a glob**, and jam.sense is why. `git ls-files
    "*requirements*.txt"` was the first version: correct in a scaffold, where the
    tree has one Python environment, and wrong in a multi-service repository,
    where six of their ten tracked requirements files describe *container images*
    and resolve nowhere near the host venv. Digesting those means a dependency
    bump to a service — most weeks — declines the link forever, for a reason with
    nothing to do with the environment being borrowed. A scaffold cannot exhibit
    that shape, so nothing here could have found it.

    **The limit, and it is the opposite error to the one above.** This covers the
    declared file and `-r` includes, and nothing else. In a scaffold that is
    complete — `setup_commands()` builds the venv with exactly one
    `pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`, and the README, `AGENTS.md` and
    `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` all say so. An adopter whose setup grows a second kind
    of input, `.venv/bin/pip install -e .` being the likely one, has made
    `pyproject.toml` a host-venv input that this does not see — and a set that is
    too narrow **links** where it should decline, which is the quiet direction.
    Too wide declines loudly and gets fixed; too narrow borrows the wrong
    environment and says nothing. Extend `_venv_inputs` when the setup block
    grows, not when a new requirements file appears.
