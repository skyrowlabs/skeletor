name: implement
description: Execute (or first write, then execute) a docs/TODO implementation plan end-to-end. Orchestrates the implementer, tester and documenter subagents from the main session, then files the completed plan to docs/implementations/. Use when the user says "implement docs/TODO/X.md", "work through the plan for X", or "plan and implement X".

# /implement — Plan Orchestrator

You are in the **main conversation**, so you CAN spawn subagents. Subagents
cannot spawn each other — that is exactly why this orchestration lives in a
skill rather than inside the implementer.

Your job: drive a `docs/TODO/*.md` spec from start to **filed**, by sequencing
focused workers and handling the cross-agent glue yourself.

| Subagent                      | Role                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{AGENT_PREFIX}}-implementer` | Phase code, gates, self-audit, commit per phase, report   |
| `{{AGENT_PREFIX}}-tester`      | Marker-registered tests, runs the suites, commits separately |
| `{{AGENT_PREFIX}}-documenter`  | Updates the docs the change invalidates                   |

Each worker returns a report. **You** read it and decide the next step.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve the spec

The argument is either a path/slug of an existing spec (**execution mode**) or a
description with no spec (**plan-then-execute**).

For plan-then-execute, spawn the implementer in Planning Mode, read the returned
path, show the user the spec and **confirm before executing**. Planning is cheap
to redo; a wrong spec is expensive to implement.

Then read the spec yourself. Extract status, priority, dependencies, phases and
every `- [ ]` task, and build a `TodoWrite` plan mirroring the phases.

**An agent-managed plan is implemented, not filed.** If its frontmatter says
`auto_generated: true` it is a derived artifact — a scheduled job rewrites it
wholesale on the next run.

```bash
grep -q "^auto_generated: true" docs/TODO/<slug>.md && echo "DERIVED — implement it, skip Step 4"
```

The work it lists is real work. What is derived is the *document*, so the two
things to skip are the two the reason actually names: **do not file it** (a move
would leave a zombie behind that the producer recreates) and **do not check off
its tasks** (hand edits are overwritten). Completed items drop out by
themselves, because the producing job stops ranking a file once its fixes ship
with tests. Say in the final report which items you closed and that the doc
self-updates.

This said *refuse the plan* — which is broader than the reason under it, and
broader than the tree's own enforcement: `{{CLI}} docs file` already refuses an
`auto_generated` plan and refuses nothing else. So the one artifact that can
block this was correct, and the prose above it told you not to start. A
test-gap backlog is the ordinary case, and it was unreachable.

## Step 1 — Implement

Spawn the implementer with the spec path. Handle its report:

- A phase came back **blocked with no path forward** → stop and surface it. A
  half-filed feature is worse than an unfiled one.
- It reports an unanticipated prerequisite → resolve that first, then re-invoke
  for the affected phase only.

## Step 2 — Tests

Spawn the tester with the implementer's changed-file list.

- ✅ green → proceed.
- ❌ **code** bug → describe the failure back to the implementer, then re-run
  the tester. Loop until green.
- ⚠️ nothing testable (pure docs/infra) → proceed, and say so.

**Tests gate filing.** Never file until the tester is green or has explicitly
reported "nothing testable".

## Step 3 — Docs

Spawn the documenter with the same changed-file list. Collect its summary.

## Step 4 — File the plan (you do this, and it is mandatory)

The spec must leave `docs/TODO/`. One command does the whole sequence:

```bash
{{CLI}} docs file <slug> --category <category>
```

It refuses a plan with unchecked tasks (`(~operator)` and `(~deferred)` excepted)
and commits nothing — read the diff.

**Then repoint what cited it. This is where this flow historically leaked.** The
move breaks links in two directions at once: every relative link *inside* the
spec (`../reports/x.md` now needs `../../`) and every link elsewhere that
pointed at its old path.

```bash
{{CLI}} check doc-refs     # docs/* paths cited from source comments
{{CLI}} check doc-links    # relative markdown links, and #fragments
```

**Repoint, never delete.** A link whose target is genuinely gone gets its
sentence rewritten to name the successor, or de-linked to a backticked path plus
the commit that removed it.

Set `agent_value` (1–3) in the filed doc's frontmatter: `3` = key design
decisions, read before modifying this system; `2` = debugging context; `1` =
historical. Rating everything `3` makes the field useless.

## Step 5 — One docs commit, then one push

Stage every pending doc change together — task check-offs, the move, reference
fixes, the regenerated indexes, and each doc the documenter touched — as ONE
commit:

```
docs(<scope>): complete <feature> — update docs, file to implementations

- Marked docs/TODO/<slug>.md complete and moved to docs/implementations/<category>/
- Regenerated the indexes
- Repointed cross-document references
- <docs the documenter updated>
```

Then push — **once**. Every commit before it stays local. Committing is free; a
push to an open PR is what spends CI minutes. If a PR is already open and out of
draft, flip it back with `gh pr ready --undo <n>` first, so the corrective push
re-runs nothing.

Verify before reporting success, then report:

```bash
ls docs/TODO/<slug>.md 2>&1 | grep -q "No such file" && echo "✅ filed" || echo "❌ NOT filed"
{{CLI}} docs index --check
```

```
✅ COMPLETE — <feature>

📁 Filed: docs/TODO/<slug>.md → docs/implementations/<category>/<slug>.md
🎯 Phases: <one line each, with commit refs>
🧪 Tests: <pass/skip summary>
📚 Docs: <what the documenter updated>
⏳ Deferred: <list or "none">

Pushed: <branch> @ <short SHA>
```

A derived plan reports the same shape with `📁 Filed:` replaced by which items
it closed and the note that the producing job drops them on its next run.

## Orchestration rules

1. **You sequence; the workers execute.** Never ask a worker to invoke another —
   they can't. All handoffs route through you.
2. **One worker at a time.** Each stage depends on the previous one's output,
   and they share files and commit history. Do not parallelize them.
3. **Tests gate filing.**
4. **Filing is yours and is mandatory.** The spec must never exist in both trees.
5. **Commit per phase, push once.** A phase boundary is a commit point, never a
   push point.
6. Any hard blocker → **stop and surface it**.
7. **Stay in the primary checkout** unless § Worktrees says otherwise. Rule 2
   keeps the workers serial, so ordinary work has nothing to collide with.

## Worktrees — when to take one, and when not to

A linked worktree is a second checkout with its own branch. **The default is
the primary checkout and that is not laziness:** a worktree implies a branch,
since two checkouts cannot share one, so taking one by reflex reintroduces
branch-and-PR ceremony for a small, self-contained, locally-verified change.

Take one when a condition holds, not as a precaution:

| Condition                                              | Why the primary will not do                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Another agent or session is already editing this tree  | A `git checkout` under them destroys uncommitted work with no error and no way back.  |
| The work genuinely needs a branch — a PR, or a review  | You cannot check out a second branch in one repo without moving the tree out from under whoever is standing in it. |
| You need a long-running stack while somebody else edits | A stack that bind-mounts the checkout can deadlock on a write beneath a mounted path. |

```bash
{{CLI}} worktree new ../<slug>-<task> -b <branch>
{{CLI}} worktree list        # what exists
{{CLI}} worktree holders     # what is holding one open
{{CLI}} worktree drop ../<slug>-<task>
```

**Remove it when the work is done**, and let `drop` refuse rather than forcing
past it: a detached worktree's commits are reachable from nothing but its own
HEAD, so that refusal is the only thing between them and silent deletion.

**Never `git checkout` in a tree you did not create.** git has no
`pre-checkout` hook, so this one is written rather than enforced.
